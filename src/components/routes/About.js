      <h1>Our history</h1>
      <p>
        Once upon a time, in the heart of Italy, there was a young woman named
        Maria who had a passion for cooking. She spent her days in the kitchen,
        experimenting with different ingredients and techniques, creating
        delicious dishes that always left her family and friends wanting more.
      </p>
      <p>
        One day, Maria decided to take her cooking to the next level and open
        her own restaurant. She had a vision for a cozy and inviting space where
        customers could enjoy authentic Italian cuisine made with fresh, locally
        sourced ingredients.
      </p>
      <p>
        After months of hard work and preparation, Maria's dream became a
        reality. She opened the doors of her new restaurant, which she named
        "Little Lemon", a nod to the bright yellow citrus fruit that is so often
        used in Italian cuisine.
      </p>
      <p>
        The restaurant quickly became a local favorite, known for its homemade
        pasta dishes, wood-fired pizzas, and decadent desserts. Maria was always
        in the kitchen, overseeing every dish that went out to the dining room
        and ensuring that each one met her high standards.
      </p>
      <p>
        As word of mouth spread, Little Lemon began to attract customers from
        all over the region. Maria hired a team of skilled chefs and waitstaff
        to help her keep up with demand, but she never lost her personal touch.
        She still made sure to greet each customer personally and make them feel
        at home in her cozy restaurant.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, Little Lemon is a beloved institution in the Italian restaurant
        scene, known not just for its delicious food but for the warm and
        welcoming atmosphere that Maria and her team have created. Maria still
        oversees the kitchen, and she takes great pride in the fact that her
        restaurant has become a hub of the local community.
